# BioRAG

BioRAG is a tool to analyze BioMODELS for researchers. 

#Required Packages:
1. langchain_community
2. chromadb
3. sentence_transformers

Also need an API key (Gemini was used in this code, but any LLM model will do the job)

Download the BioMODEL files from this repository and use the path to pull the files into the code.
